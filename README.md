DEVOPS ASSEMBLY LINES [TASK2]

Problem Statement :

Create a container image thatâ€™s has Jenkins installed using Dockerfile.

When we launch this image, it should automatically start the Jenkins service in the container.

Create a job chain of job1, job2, job3 and job4 using the build pipeline plugin in Jenkins.

Job1: Pull the GitHub repo automatically when some developers push the repo to GitHub.

Job2: By looking at the code or program file, Jenkins should automatically start the respective language interpreter install image container to deploy code ( eg. If code is of PHP, then Jenkins should start the container that has PHP already installed ).

Job3: Test your app if it is working or not.

Job4: If the app is not working, then send an email to the developer with error messages.

Create One extra job job5 for monitor: If the container where the app is running. fails due to any reason then this job should automatically start the container again.

SOLUTION :-

1)Creating a docker image which install jenkins image and jenkins service

2)After building the docker then i run docker image which has jenins install in port no 8084



3)After that creating the job1(Note:github is the name there), job2, job3 and job4 by using build pipeline
